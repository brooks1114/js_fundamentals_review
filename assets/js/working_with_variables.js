// Question 5
// Why might you choose to use the const keyword?
// A: If you created a variable that you wanted to ensure was never capable of being updated. Example, a const for Pi, you would not want code updating that variable. 

// Question 6
// What is one reason it not best practice to use the var keyword?
// A: javascript interprets what the variable is when declared as var, instead of using a defined type (i.e. int, string). There is risk in using var, if the 
// var variable is sent into a loop/function for example, the data type could be changed by js, and could result in a mismatch of data types later in the code / bugs.
